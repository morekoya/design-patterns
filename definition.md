Design Patterns
1. Singeleton design pettern: Ensure a class only has one Instance and provide a global point of access
2. Abstract_factory design pattern: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete class.
3. Adapter method design pattern: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
4. Factory method design pattern: Define an interface for createing an object but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses
5. Bridge design pattern: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
6. Command design pattern: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
7. Ccomposite design pattern: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
8. Decorator method design pattern: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
9. Facade design pattern: hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern adds an interface to existing system to hide its complexities. Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
10. Flyweight design pattern: hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern adds an interface to existing system to hide its complexities.
11. Interpreter design pattern: provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expression. This type of pattern comes under behavioral pattern. This pattern involves implementing an expression interface which tells to interpret a particular context. 
12. Chain of resposibility design pattern: Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more thanone object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
13. Iterator design pattern: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expression. This pattern involves implementing an expression interface which tells to interpret a particular context. This pattern is used in SQL parsing nsd symbol processing engine amogst others.
14. Mediator design pattern: reduce communication complexity between multiple objects or classes. This pattern provides a mediator class which normally handles all the communications between different classes and supports easy maintenance of the code by loose coupling.
15. Memento design pattern: is used to restore state of an object to a previous state. 
16. Obesrver pattern: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
17. Proxy design pattern: provide a surrugate / placeholder for another object to control access to it.
18. Prototype design pattern: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
19. State design patter: Allow an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
20. Strategy designpattern: Here, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies as per its strategy object. The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
21. templet_method design pattern: Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithmâ€™s structure.
22. Visitotr design pattern: represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
